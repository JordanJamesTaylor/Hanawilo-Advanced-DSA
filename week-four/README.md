Challenge 1: 
Given the following graphs, appropriately label them as being undirected-weighted, directed-
weighted, undirected-unweighted, and directed-unweighted. 

Graph #1: Undirected-unweighted  
Graph #2: Undirected-wighted
Graph #3: Directed-weighted
Graph #4: Directed-unweighted

Challenge 2: Define what vertices and edges mean to you.

Vertices are similiar to nodes. They are a point in a data structure that holds data; it can also hold meta data regarding it's place within the structure and it's relationships to other vertices (directional/undirectional).

Edges are connections between two verticies within a larger data structure. Edges will be formed based on the conditions of the larger data structure (is an edge between two verticies direction/undirectional, weighted/unweighted).
